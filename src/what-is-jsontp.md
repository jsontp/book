# What is jsontp?
- `jsontp` is a new standard, aimed to increase interoperability with existing standards across the web, rather than relying on the unique nature of HTTP.
- it uses `TCP` as the transport layer, and `JSON` as the data format, which is already widely used across the web.
# Why jsontp?
- `jsontp` is designed to be a more efficient and reliable way to transfer data across the web. It's standard is stricter than HTTP, and it's designed to be very similar if not the same across all platforms.
- the standard, while written in formal English, is not written in a way that is difficult to understand. It's designed to be easy to understand and implement.
# Core concepts
- there are two main concepts in `jsontp`: the `request` and the `response`. The `request` is the data that is sent to the server, and the `response` is the data that is sent back to the client. 
- the `request` and `response` are both `JSON` objects, and they are both sent over `TCP`.
- they are both sent in a specific format, which is defined in the `jsontp` standard, and explained later in this book.
