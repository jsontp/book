# Headers
- jsontp headers are the headers that are sent with the `request` and `response` messages
- they are more strictly defined than HTTP headers, and are designed to be more reliable
- however, they are still very similar to HTTP headers, and are designed to be easy to understand and implement
- unlike HTTP headers, jsontp headers are case-insensitive
